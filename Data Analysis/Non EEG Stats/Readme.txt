This folder contains the code for a C# project meant to analyze the correlations between non-eeg metrics recorded during the experiments and questionnaire results.

Also makes useful tables for papers.

Since this is a "code only" repository, the project itself is not included.
The Accord.Net framework is used for the statistical tests - this will need to be installed locally.
