This folder contains the code from a C# project used to analyse the EEG features recorded during the experiments. Bear in mind the raw EEG data has been processed using Matlab scripts.

Also includes some machine learning using the Accord.Net framework for convenience.

The statistics file has a few statistical significance tests for results obtained using a genetic algorithm for feature selection.
