This folder contains a few versions of the windows key and mouse move logger used during the PhD experiments.
Some versions connect to the EEG recording software and send direct triggers via TCP on keypresses. One of the versions however does not require that connection.
All versions dump the logs in text files on localhost.

There is also an eeglogger, that receives the raw eeg data from the recording software via TCP.
